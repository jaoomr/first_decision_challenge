swirltex ,"swirltex has developed a membrane filtration system for treating wastewater.the swirltex lagoon unit (slu) has potential to be transformative for municipalities reliant on lagoon systems as well as for industrial applications. wastewater has traditionally been difficult to treat through membrane filtration due to surface fouling by pollutants. the slu overcomes fouling by creating a centrifugal flow pattern, preventing contaminants from contacting the tubular membrane, thus creating a much more effective system. swirltex will sell the service of treated water per unit volume. it is an affordable option for smaller centers that cannot afford large capital outlays and creates marketable reuse water. the initial target market is municipalities at risk of environmental non-compliance. for the future, swirltex will be developing oil and gas applications. our goal is to supply the market demand for recycled industrial water, which will continue to grow with increasing regulatory pressures.",1.0,,calgary,alberta,51.05011,-114.08528999999999,True
